# HuoguoML Serving

## Introduction

HuoguoML Serving is an external tool to create a REST service from your registered models. Furthermore, all HugouoML Serving services are logged to the HuoguoML dashboard, giving you an integrated monitoring solution. Besides, these services are written with FastAPI and can be extended to support other monitoring tools \(see: [Monitor HuoguoML Service](monitor-huoguoml-serving-service.md)\).
