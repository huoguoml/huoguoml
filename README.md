When dealing with Machine Learning applications, there is a high management and coordination effort for data scientists, as they have to collaborately analyze, evaluate and update many different models with different metadata on a regular basis. **HuoguoML** aims to simplify the management process by providing a platform for managing and serving machine learning models. Key features are:

- An API to log parameters, code, and results of machine learning experiments. 
- A powerful dashboard for comparing and analysing logged experiments
- A CLI to easily launch a REST service from your logged experiments that are updated over the air and easily customizable.
